They differ from kangaroo mice in not having the soles of the feet entirely covered in fur. Kangaroo rats have fur-lined pockets, but they are larger, and have a dark stripe across the hips and dark stripes on both the top and bottom surfaces of the tail.&#x5b;2&#x5d;&#x3c;&#x2f;p&#x3e;&#xd;&#xa;&#x3c;p&#x3e;The San Joaquin pocket mouse has a total length of about 128 to 160 mm &#x28;5.0 to 6.3 in&#x29;, including a tail of 65 to 78 mm &#x28;2.6 to 3.1 in&#x29;. The tail has a short tuft of hairs at its tip. The fur on the head and body is short and soft, without spines or bristles. The colour is buff, and there is sometimes a pale patch at the base of the small rounded ears. The tail is identically-coloured on its upper and lower surfaces.&#x5b;2&#x5d;&#x3c;&#x2f;p&#x3e;</content><private>Y</private><author></author></item>
